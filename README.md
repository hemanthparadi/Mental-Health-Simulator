Mental Health Simulator
This project is a mental health awareness and simulation tool built for academic and learning purposes.
It focuses on helping users understand different mental health states through simulated scenarios and interactions, without providing medical diagnosis or treatment.

Project Objective
To create awareness about mental health conditions in a safe and non-clinical manner
To simulate common emotional or mental states based on user inputs
To encourage understanding, empathy, and responsible discussion around mental health
Key Features
Interactive user input to simulate different mental health scenarios
Scenario-based outputs explaining possible emotional states
Simple and user-friendly interface
Focus on awareness, not diagnosis or medical advice
Important Disclaimer
This project is not a medical tool and does not provide diagnosis, treatment, or professional mental health advice.
It is strictly an educational and awareness-based simulator.
Users experiencing mental health issues should consult qualified professionals.
